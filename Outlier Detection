Done a thorough analysis of the "revenue_realized" column in df_bookings dataset, specifically checking for outliers. 

Initial Outlier Detection:

Identified rows where revenue_realized was greater than mean + 3 * std, which is a standard method for detecting outliers based on statistical thresholds.
Found 1,299 such rows, which indicated that these values were flagged as outliers based on this threshold.

Investigation of the Outliers:

Despite being flagged as outliers, observed that the maximum value of "revenue_realized" didn't seem unreal or out of place.
After further checking the room category for these flagged values, realized they all fell under the RT4 room category (presidential suites), 
which seems reasonable in this context. 
This suggests that these high values might not be outliers at all but rather a feature of this specific room category.

Re-evaluation of Outliers within RT4:

Conducted a more detailed analysis specifically for the RT4 room category, recalculating the mean and standard deviation for just those rows.
Found that for RT4 rooms, the mean + 3 * std threshold was 50,583, and the flagged revenue_realized values were within this range.

Conclusion:

Since the values for revenue_realized within the RT4 category fall within the expected range (and no values appear unreal or inappropriate), 
Concluded that there are no actual outliers.

Therefore, no cleaning is required for this column, as the high values are valid and aligned with the characteristics of the RT4 rooms (presidential suites).

Key Insights:

Outlier detection methods like mean + 3 * std are useful, but they should be combined with domain knowledge to avoid misidentifying valid extreme values as outliers.

In this case, the RT4 rooms naturally have higher revenue, and these values were not incorrect outliers but rather expected high revenue from that category.

This type of analysis illustrates how important it is to understand the context of the data (in this case, the RT4 category) 
before deciding to remove or adjust data points flagged as outliers.

So, in summary, Correctly assessed that no cleaning is necessary, and the flagged rows are indeed legitimate given the context of the RT4 room category.
